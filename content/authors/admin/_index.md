I am a Rendering Research Scientist at Pixar Animation Studios. My job is to power the filmmaking process by innovating new technology and build tools to make artists life easier in the studio.

I received Ph.D. in computer science (Google PhD Fellow) in 2021. I am deeply honored to have worked with talented people at other institutions including Apple (2018), Disney Research (2019), Walt Disney Imagineering (2019), and Weta Digital VFX (2021).

Contributing technology for storytelling gives me lots of joy in my life. As part of the Walt Disney family, I believe any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. We stand behind every pixel on the screen.
