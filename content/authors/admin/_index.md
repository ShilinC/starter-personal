I am a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in computer science (Google PhD Fellow) at University of California, San Diego. My research stands at the intersection of graphics, vision, and photography, sometimes powered by magical machine learning. 

I will join Pixar Animation Studios as a Rendering Research Scientist upon graduation. My job is to power the filmmaking process by innovating new technology and build tools to make artists life easier in the studio. Contributing technology for storytelling gives me lots of joy in my life. As part of the Walt Disney family, I believe any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. We stand behind every pixel on the screen.

I am deeply honored to have worked with talented people at other institutions including Apple (2018), Disney Research (2019), Walt Disney Imagineering (2019), and Weta Digital VFX (2021).
