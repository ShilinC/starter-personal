I am a <span style="color:#bdffee">Research Scientist</span> at <span style="color:#bde2ff">Pixar Animation Studios</span>. My job is to create lifelike pictures by innovating new computer technology, build tools to make artists life easier, and work with other Disney subsidiaries (<span style="color:#ffcbbd">Walt Disney Animation Studios</span> and <span style="color:#f4ffbd">Disney Research Studios</span>) to push our picture quality to a new level. Contributing technology for storytelling gives me lots of joy in my life. As part of the <span style="color:#ccbdff">Walt Disney Company</span>, I believe any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. We stand behind every pixel on the screen.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science (Google PhD Fellow) at <span style="color:#bde2ff">University of California, San Diego</span> in 2021. My research stands at the intersection of graphics, vision, and photography, sometimes powered by magical machine learning. I have published more than 30 academic papers which are recognized worldwide in Computer Science related fields. 

On the production side, my work on efficient path sampling for rendering has been pushed to the visual effect pipeline of <span style="color:#ffbde1">Weta Digital</span> to produce Avatar sequels (Directed by James Cameron) and future live action films.

I am deeply honored to have worked with talented people at other institutions including <span style="color:#c8ffbd">Apple</span> (2018), <span style="color:#f4ffbd">Disney Research</span> (2019), <span style="color:#ccbdff">Walt Disney Imagineering - Theme Parks</span> (2019), and <span style="color:#ffbde1">Weta Digital VFX</span> (2021).

<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS">"Everybody in the world was once a child. So in planning a new picture, we don't think of grown-ups, and we don't think of children, but just of that fine, clean, unspoiled spot down deep in every one of us that maybe the world has made us forget, and that maybe our pictures can help recall."  <span style="float:right;"><span>&#8212;&#8212;</span>  Walt Disney</span></p>
