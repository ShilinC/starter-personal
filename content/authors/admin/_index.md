I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science (Google PhD Fellow) at University of California, San Diego in 2021. My research stands at the intersection of graphics, vision, and photography, sometimes powered by magical machine learning. 

I will join Pixar Animation Studios as a Research Scientist from 2022. My job is to power the filmmaking process by innovating new technology and build tools to make artists life easier in the studio. Contributing technology for storytelling gives me lots of joy in my life. As part of the Walt Disney family, I believe any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. We stand behind every pixel on the screen.

I am deeply honored to have worked with talented people at other institutions including Apple (2018), Disney Research (2019), Walt Disney Imagineering - Theme Parks (2019), and Weta Digital VFX (2021).

My favorite Walt Disney quote is "Everybody in the world was once a child. So in planning a new picture, we don't think of grown-ups, and we don't think of children, but just of that fine, clean, unspoiled spot down deep in every one of us that maybe the world has made us forget and that maybe our pictures can help recall."
